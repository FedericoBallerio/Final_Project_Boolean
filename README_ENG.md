# E-commerce Data Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset downloaded from Kaggle to extract strategic business insights. The analysis focuses on two main areas: the impact of discounts on profitability and the prediction of product returns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data acquisition, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, machine learning
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Kaggle, XLRD, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations

## Results
The analysis yielded specific recommendations for discount strategies and identifies key factors influencing product returns. The machine learning model provides a practical tool for predicting return probability.

## Getting Started
Instructions for accessing the dataset, running the analysis, and exploring the interactive dashboards are available in the project files.
